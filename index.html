    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Rahmath from the charming town of Mancherial. I'm currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology, where I maintain a strong GPA of 9. My passion truly lies in web development, and I'm always eager to dive into new projects. When I'm not coding or studying, you'll often find me engrossed in a captivating book. Additionally, I enjoy taking solitary walks and savoring my favorite foods. Both reading, coding, and my moments of solitude and culinary indulgences are how I like to unwind and make the most of my free time.</p>
